# Daily Coding Challenges

This repository serves as a personal "code gym" for practicing various programming challenges, including those from Advent of Code and Project Euler. The goal is to solve problems in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, C, Rust) to deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and language-specific features.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main sections:

- `advent-of-code`: Solutions for the yearly Advent of Code challenges. Each year has its own subdirectory, with subfolders for different programming languages.
- `math-problems`: Solutions for problems from Project Euler, a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.

## Getting Started

To create a new problem entry, you can use the provided bash scripts.

### For Advent of Code:

Use the `advent-of-code.sh` script to set up the file structure for a new daily problem.

```sh
./advent-of-code.sh <PROBLEM_NUMBER> <PROBLEM_TITLE> [YEAR]
```

Example: ./advent-of-code.sh 001 historian_hysteria 2024

For Project Euler:

Use the new-math.sh script to create files for a new Project Euler problem.
Bash

./new-math.sh <PROBLEM_NUMBER> <PROBLEM_TITLE>

Example: ./new-math.sh 001 multiples-of-3-or-5

Contributing

This is a personal practice repository, but feel free to explore the solutions or use the setup scripts for your own practice.
